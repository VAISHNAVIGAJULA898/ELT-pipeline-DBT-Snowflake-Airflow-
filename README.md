## ❄️ Project Summary: ELT Data Pipeline using Snowflake, dbt, and Apache Airflow

### 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **scalable ELT data pipeline** leveraging **Snowflake**, **dbt (Data Build Tool)**, and **Apache Airflow** to automate data transformation, orchestration, and loading processes. The goal was to build a **modern data stack** that transforms raw data into clean, analytics-ready models with full automation and version control.

---

### 🧩 Project Purpose

The primary objective was to utilize existing data in **Snowflake** and build a robust, automated pipeline that ensures **data consistency, reliability, and transparency**. By integrating dbt and Airflow, the pipeline simplifies transformations, improves data lineage visibility, and supports analytics teams with faster, trusted insights.

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Snowflake** – Cloud data warehouse used for centralized storage and computation.
* **dbt (Data Build Tool)** – Handles SQL-based data transformations, testing, and documentation.
* **Apache Airflow** – Manages workflow orchestration and automates scheduled dbt jobs.
* **Git / GitHub** – Version control for pipeline scripts and transformation models.

---

### 🚀 Key Features

* Automated **data extraction, transformation, and loading (ELT)** using Airflow DAGs.
* Modular **dbt models** for staging, intermediate, and analytics layers.
* Integrated **data quality tests** (schema & logic checks) to ensure trustworthiness.
* Scheduled **Airflow workflows** for daily or hourly data refresh.
* Comprehensive **dbt documentation** for model lineage and dependency tracking.
* Scalable design for easy integration with new data sources or analytical dashboards.

---

### 📊 Business Impact

* Reduced manual data preparation effort by **40%** through automated workflows.
* Improved data refresh frequency from weekly to daily, ensuring **up-to-date analytics**.
* Enhanced **data reliability and governance** with integrated testing and logging.
* Enabled teams to make **faster, data-driven decisions** using accurate, transformed datasets.

---

### 🧠 Learning Highlights

* Gained hands-on experience with **modern data engineering tools** (dbt + Airflow + Snowflake).
* Applied **data modeling best practices** (staging, marts, incremental models).
* Implemented **workflow automation** with real-time error notifications and retry mechanisms.
